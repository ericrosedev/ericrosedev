# Hi, I'm Eric 💁🏻‍♂️

I’m a web designer and developer.

I like building things for the internet that people can enjoy.

I’ve been doing this full time since 2013, before that I was an intelligence analyst in the military and an intelligence instructor for the department of defense.

I love science fiction novels __[📚](http://www.thehugoawards.org/)__ and short stories __[📘](https://www.asimovs.com/)__ __[📕](https://www.analogsf.com/)__, running __[🏃‍♂️](https://www.nike.com/nrc-app)__, maps __[🗺️](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/)__, boats __[🛥️](https://twxuu.csb.app/boat.jpg)__, coffee __[☕](https://www.traderjoes.com/digin/tag/Coffee/)__, and taking miss Dakota __[🐕](https://twxuu.csb.app/dog.png)__ to the dog park.
